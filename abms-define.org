Sub-Agents (the populations in each language group) [Object]
	Monitoring level 0-1: based on how many speakers share thier repertoire. More shared = lower monitoring
		Either calculated in the model OR defined as a [MODEL PARAMETER]
	Language Mode 0-1 [How is language mode represented with >1 language. Do I need hgher dimensions?]
		https://www.francoisgrosjean.ch/bilin_bicult/10%20Grosjean.pdf [1]
	List of languages: Random permutation of connected languages AND group affiliated language.
	Calculation of word form biases (Ellison & Miceli, 2017)
	
	Pandas dataframe:
	| UID | MONITORING LEVEL | MODE                  | LANG LIST |
	+-----+------------------+-----------------------+-----------+
	| int | double			 | multidimenisonal list | [,]       |
	
	Things to consider:
		Calculating language mode.
		Calculating Monitoring level.
		How likely is it to learn subsequent languages [MODEL PARAMETER]
		
Language Forms (The forms used in each language as they change over time.) [Object]
	This implies that a group can only directly affect its affiliated language.
	Any group's usage of thier affiliated language will directly affect how Sub-Agents/individuals in other groups use that language. This is a forseen side-effect. 
		If this isn't the case, the model needs greater complexity. And it would mean that language groups would cause divergence for all thier languages.
