* Introduction
Bilingualism, or more generally multilingualism, is common in the world today; estimates suggest that two-thirds of children grow up in bilingual environments \citep{crystal_2003}. The prevalence of bilinguals means that they can have a significant impact on languages spoken throughout the world. Studies of bilingual individuals and their behaviours compared to their less common monolingual neighbours, are thus important in understanding the history of languages. The effects that bilingual speakers' linguistic configurations have on their language production offer potential insights into how bilingual speakers may affect the linguistic system over time. Bilingual speakers are not simply a person who has the same competency as a monolingual in multiple languages, but rather, persons with a unique bilingual configuration of language processing. Evidence for this includes differences in their language production behaviour. They make different lexical choices, they may code-switch between languages, their phonological system is coloured by their native language when speaking another, and their expressivity may vary between their languages. This thesis focuses on the impacts that bilinguals' behaviour has on the lexicons of the languages they speak. We look at the effect that their lexical production choices have diachronically.

Considering bilingual speakers in this way has inspired ideas and models to explain the differences in behaviour that we observe. The concept of Language Mode is at the heart of one such model, proposed by \citet{Grosjean2012}. Language Mode is "the state of activation of the bilingual's languages and language-processing mechanisms at a given point in time" \citep{Grosjean2012}. Language Mode is expressed as a continuum (see Section [[Language Mode]]). One end has the Monolingual Language Mode, where a speaker behaves similarly to a monolingual speaker and activation of the other languages in their repertoire is low. At the other end of the scale, Bilingual Language mode activates both (or more) languages, and behaviour is less like that of a monolingual speaker; more lexical transfer occurs between their languages and there is more code switching.

Another parameter seeking to explain the behaviours of bilinguals is production Monitoring \citep{deGroot2011}. Monitoring accounts for the behavioural peculiarities of bilingual speakers as coming from them monitoring the output they produce. The monitor limits the forms that are produced by filtering out those identified as not belonging to the language the speaker is using. This means that bilinguals even in Bilingual Mode produce only words from the language which they intend to speak, despite all forms for the meaning being activated highly.

\citet{EllisonMiceli2017} argue that both of these parameters are necessary to adequately explain the behaviour of bilinguals in lexical selection and production, and propose a cognitive model incorporating both Mode and Monitoring. This model focuses on the forms produced by bilingual speakers. It predicts that differing combinations of Mode and Monitoring result in different distributions of forms being produced. Which lexical item is produced, and which language it is from depend on where along the monolingual - bilingual mode continuum at the time, and how strictly they are monitoring their output.

Some languages share common forms for particular meanings, due to borrowing, common descent from an ancestor language, or some other reason (such as chance). Forms that are shared between languages are problematic for bilingual speakers, as such forms are all highly activated compared to forms present only in a single language. This makes them prone to over-filtering when monitoring, as they appear to be intrusions due to their ambiguous language membership. \citet{EllisonMiceli2017} refer to these forms, when present in a bilingual speaker's combined linguistic system, as /doppels/. When attempting to produce a form for a particular meaning, many forms from a speaker's languages are activated. These forms come from all the speaker's languages, and may include alternative, non-doppel forms for the same meaning. These synonyms are alternative forms that both bilinguals and monolinguals can use. These doppels are used less frequently by bilinguals when there is an alternative non-doppel synonym \citep{EllisonMiceli2017}. 

Because bilinguals make up a significant proportion of the world's speakers, their impact on language change over time can be significant. \citet{EllisonMiceli2017} simulate the effects of bilinguals on the lexical forms of lone, bilingual communities. They find that in many cases the presence of bilinguals acting in moderate bilingual mode and monitoring their output results in shared doppel forms being progressively lost from languages, in favour of non-doppel forms in each language. This leads to lexical diversification in the languages.

This thesis builds upon this idea, and investigates the effect that multilingual speakers, in more complicated networks of communities, have on the languages of the communities they inhabit. Agent-Based Modelling is used to simulate multilingual communities in a range of contact networks. Simulation allows us to observe the effects on language variability and the effects on the spatial distribution of lexical forms. Investigating this type of language diversification is important to understand the effects of bilingual speakers on lexical change diachronically. It may assist with explaining situations where there is a significant degree of lexical diversity. My simulations make predictions about the patterns of lexical diversity in a region based on the presence of bilingual speaker, given certain levels of language activation and monitoring.

My case study focuses on the Indigenous languages of Victoria. I use lexical data recorded from these languages, as well as spatial data, for our simulations. I compare the results of the simulations with the observed lexical diversity in the region to evaluate the model and its assumptions.

* Background
This thesis has been developed in order to address, in part, what could be considered a gap in the modelling of diachronic language development. The gap that we intend to address concerns the effect of bilingual speakers on the overall linguistic systems of the languages that they speak. Evidence of structural and cognitive differences in the brain between bi- and monolingual speakers exists in a variety of studies, conducted using neuroimaging techniques \citep{Kovelman2008, WangXiang2011}, as well as reviews of such studies \citep{Hayakawa2019, Grundy2017}. The structural and cognitive difference is also accompanied by a noted behavioural difference in the processing of bilingual stimuli \citep{Kovelman2008, Lehtonen2012}. \citet{Kovelman2008}, for example, used bilingual sentence judgement tasks to explore similarities and differences in behavioural and neural responses between bilinguals and monolinguals using fMRI.

Accounting for these behavioural differences in production has resulted in a number of possible mechanisms that produce the kinds of behaviour that we observe. Models attempting to explain observed differences have been developed, including a model whereby a speaker's languages are activated with differing intensity depending on a range of factors, and a model in which subconscious monitoring of one's production ensures a language-appropriate form is used.

** Language Mode
In the first instance, the concept of language Mode is developed by \citet{grosjean1985} as a representation of a bilingual speaker's language activation. In more bilingual language mode, the speaker behaviour will produce language in line with their bilingual competence; engaging in language mixing via code-switching and nonce borrowing of words between these languages. In this mode, both of their languages are highly activated, so production is influenced considerably by both. In more monolingual mode, a speaker will behave as similarly as possible to a monolingual speaker. This mode means that only a single language is highly activated. Language mode depends on the environment of interaction that the speaker is in. Speakers in situations where use of multiple languages in their linguistic repertoire is not marked (i.e. not atypical, such as a casual chat with other bilinguals) will operate in /bilingual mode/, where  "Once  a  particular  language  has been  chosen  as  the  base  language, they [the bilingual speaker] bring  in  the  other  language  in  various ways" \citep[pp. 28]{grosjean1985}. Bilinguals will never produce language identically to a monolingual. Even in monolingual mode they are prone to rare intrusions from their other languages; "The bilingual is NOT the sum of two complete or incomplete monolinguals; rather,  he  or  she  has  a  unique  and  specific  linguistic  configuration" \citep[pp. 24]{grosjean1985}. Figure [[fig:grosjeanMode]] below is Grosjean's visual representation of Language Mode.

** Language Monitoring
Accounting for bilingual behaviour with a Monitoring parameter involves a speaker filtering the distribution of possible forms. In a monitoring only explanation, when a bilingual speaks all forms for the meaning they intend to express are activated, regardless of the language they are part of \citep{deGroot2011}. Forms which are not part of the target language are filtered out, narrowing the distribution of possible forms. How closely a speaker monitors their speech is what results in the difference of production seen in bilinguals. Highly monitoring speakers will have few intrusions, while low monitoring individuals will have many more intrusions. Instead of a continuum of language mode this is a continuum of monitoring effort. 

** Combining Mode and Monitoring
The behavioural differences observed between bilinguals when compared to monolinguals are not able to adequately be explained by either of these two models separately. Due to this \citet[pp. 265]{EllisonMiceli2017} propose a model incorporating both a language Mode parameter and an output Monitoring Parameter. The model described in \citep{EllisonMiceli2017} results in a number of predictions about the diachronic outcomes of this combination of language mode and monitoring. The major finding is the prediction of the avoidance of lexical items which are shared by a speaker's languages.

The model from \citet{EllisonMiceli2017} is concerned with bilingual production of lexical forms. Experiments from \citet{EllisonMiceli2017} confirm that there is a small but significant bias against lexical forms which are shared between a bilinguals languages. 

These forms, referred to as /Doppels/, are lexical forms which have a similar form and meaning in the languages of a speaker's repertoire. When referring to similar form we intend to say that doppels sound similar. However, they don't have to be exact matches. Where Ellison and Miceli commonly provide the example of the Dutch-English correspondence of 'Foto' and 'Photo' \citep[pp. 270]{EllisonMiceli2017}, another example could be the English-Polish pair 'Information' and 'Informacja' (Ellison and Miceli, personal correspondence, July 17, 2021), which are similar but not as close as the two pronunciations of 'foto'.

Doppels only exist as doppels when bilingual speakers have to produce such form-meaning combinations, and thus don't exist between languages which share no bilingual speakers. Doppels are forms for a meaning which appear in multiple of a speakers languages. Therefore doppels are produced from a distribution of forms which are activated for a given meaning. Other non-doppel forms can exist for meanings, which are simply forms that are synonymous with the doppel. These non-doppel synonyms compete against doppels when a meaning can be expressed with multiple synonymous forms. If there are no synonymous non-doppels to compete against the doppel, an anti-doppel bias cannot exist, as there are no competing forms to be filtered out by monitoring, or differentially activated under differing language modes.

The term Doppel is used in \citet{EllisonMiceli2017} in order to avoid confusion with the term /cognate/, which is used in psycholinguistic research to refer to the same concept. Given the focus of their paper on the diachronic effect of bilinguals encountering these forms, the choice was made to reserve the term /cognates/ for its interpretation in historical linguistic literature.In this sense, cognates are words which share an etymological origin, no matter how dissimilar in form they may be in their modern forms.

The model proposed is comprised of several parts. The input a speaker receives is internalised as distributions of forms for a meaning in one of their languages. When a speaker intends to speak, their level of language mode impacts the activation of forms from their languages. If a speaker is in monolingual mode with a target of /Language \textsc{a}/ forms that are associated with the 2meaning /language \textsc{a]/ will be highly activated. Forms from their other language, /Language \textsc{b}/ will be activated, but only minorly. In bilingual mode, however forms from both of the speaker's language will be highly activated. These forms are then filtered by Monitoring. A speaker monitoring their output closely will filter out forms that are not associated with their target language, preventing them (to the best of their ability) from being produced. After the processes of the internalised distribution, activation, and filtering of the forms, the speaker has a range of possible forms to produce. Forms which are not highly activated, or are filtered as not being in the target language, will be unlikely to be produced. The speaker then produces a form from this distribution of forms. Figure [[fig:eMmodel]] visually represents this Model.

** The presence of doppels in languages
Doppels are obviously most likely to be found in related languages, where there exists some amount of inherited vocabulary. This is due to the occurrence of forms similar in form and meaning being generally uncommon by chance (cf. \citet{Greenberg1987} and discussions therearound from \citet{Ringe1992, Ringe1993, Manaster1996, Greenberg1993}. Despite being unlikely in unrelated languages, one could conceive of scenarios in which two languages come to share forms that are doppel to bilingual speakers, such as through borrowing. Predictions on the fate of these forms in the cognitive model proposed in \citet{EllisonMiceli2017} are dependant on the Mode and Monitoring parameters of speakers. The model predicts both /facilitation/ and an /anti-doppel bias/ with different mode and monitoring combinations. Facilitation of Doppels results in Doppel forms becoming more frequent in the languages due to the significant frequency benefit to these forms which occur when bilingual speakers are operating in a highly bilingual mode, but not strictly monitoring their output to ensure they are producing language-appropriate forms. The more common outcome is that of an anti-doppel bias, which occurs most strongly when bilinguals act as they would in bilingual mode, with strict monitoring of their production. These predictions from the model are recapitulated by Ellison and Miceli, by noting that "Bilingual mode favours doppels, while monitoring discourages them" \citep[pp. 267]{EllisonMiceli2017}.



Ellison and Miceli's model is used to describe the results of experimental data collected of Dutch-English Bilinguals. These bilinguals were tested with tasks designed to encourage acting in bilingual mode in which they responded to prompts intended to elicit forms that were Doppel for Dutch-English bilinguals, and were compared to a control group of Monolingual English speakers. The results were such that Dutch-English bilinguals displayed "significant disfavouring of doppel use" confirming that "doppels are less likely to be selected by a bilingual speaker when a non-doppel synonym is available" \citep[pp. 270]{EllisonMiceli2017}. When the model's predictions were fit to the observations from the experimental data the best fit was found to be a moderate bilingual mode parameter of 54%, with strict monitoring of 100% \citep[pp. 272]{EllisonMiceli2017}. 

** Simulations of Diachronic effects
Ellison and Miceli extended the predictive nature of the model to its diachronic effects on the language's lexicon. In a number of simulations consisting of communities of bi- and monolingual speakers the effect of the bias against doppel forms present at the mode and monitoring parameters of 54% and 100%, a consistent pattern emerged. This pattern resulted in the languages no longer sharing a form which was a doppel for bilingual speakers in the community. The specific results of these simulations are discussed in Section [[Simulations]]. The results from the simulation indicated that this anti-doppel bias effect would potentially be a strong driver of language divergence.

Modelling the effects of cognitive processes of bilingual speakers on a language's vocabulary requires a simulation that can show information about both the linguistic system and the individual cognitive process. For this purpose an Agent-Based Model was developed for investigating the diachronic effects. An agent-based model "consists  of  creating  an  artificial  population   of   agents   that   can   represent   individuals,   organisations,  or  several  groups  within  a  society" \citep[pp. 149]{eberlenscholzandgagliolo2017}. This focus on modelling individuals within a population obviously lends itself to modelling individual processes such as the cognitive model from \citet{EllisonMiceli2017}. Individual agents in the model "act  autonomously  according  to  rules  that  have  been  defined  when  programming  the  model" \citep[pp. 150]{eberlenscholzandgagliolo2017}. These rules involve the interactions between agents, the decisions each agent can make, and the agent's interaction with their environment. Agent based models are "a  way  of  conducting  virtual  experiments  consisting  of  computer  simulations" \citep[pp. 150]{eberlenscholzandgagliolo2017}. While it is possible for us to conduct experiments confirming the dissimilar usage of doppel forms between bi- and monolingual speakers \citep{EllisonMiceli2017}, it is not possible for us to conduct experiments regarding diachronic change over a long time with actual human participants. The agent-based modelling paradigm is useful for developing these "virtual experiments", as it allows us to keep the focus on the role of individual speakers. We can model speakers as agents which have a repertoire of languages, and that produce forms according to the rules of the mathematical model in \citet{EllisonMiceli2017}.

This allows for the isolation of the effect that the cognitive process has on language's lexicons, which would not be possible to do with human subjects. In contrast with some simulation methods which can be described as "top-down approaches to modelling systems" \citep[pp. 145]{Macal2016}, agent-based systems are motivated by "the desire to model the world around us in a way that is more faithful to the real world" \citep[pp. 145]{Macal2016}. This allows for a minimal jump between the model results and the real-world explanation for those results. The ability to create a simulation focused only on the effects of the cognitive processes means that the simulations involved are limited to investigating a single effect. Due to this the simulation is not intended to be a model of language diversification as a whole. By extending the model of bilingual lexical processing through time the intent is to observe the outcomes of multiple individuals acting in accordance with Ellison and Miceli's model. The fact that this is likely to lead to lexical diversification in many instances indicates only that this process would lead to diversification in isolation, without consideration of other processes that may occur. 

The modelling in this paper was developed directly from the mathematical model of \citet{EllisonMiceli2017}, and is not an extension of the simulation package provided in that work. Developing directly from the mathematical model provided the ability to structure the simulation differently to allow a network structure of connected language communities. This network approach is employed to add a degree of spatial data to the model environment which dictates the possible interactions of communities of speakers. Additional spatial data allows us to investigate the relationship between the vocabulary of a language (whether or not it contains doppel forms) and the vocabularies of other languages with which its speakers have contact. With this relationship as a focus this research intends to focus on the patterns of the frequencies of vocabulary items that emerge across an area of space with distinct languages and communities.

** Importance
Modelling the processes described in Ellison and Miceli's model is important for investigating why and how languages diverge. Divergence of lexical items as a result of a bias against doppel forms is important to consider when examining the history of languages and the speakers of them.
*** Supplementary to Historical Linguistics Inquiries
The history of languages is generally inferred via the comparative method in historical linguistics \citep{Campbell2001, Weiss2015}. The comparative method can be used to examine the relatedness of languages for which regular sound correspondences can be established \citep{Weiss2015}. Cognate forms which are present in multiple languages due to apparent mutual descent from a common ancestor language are also a much needed component for this analysis. The common use of the comparative method is remarkably successful in establishing relatedness between languages, particularly in the realm of Indo-European linguistics \citep{Beekes2011, Collinge1985}.

When languages have such a variety of well-established sound correspondences, the comparative method works well to establish language histories and can give insights into the history of the speakers of those languages. However when such correspondences are more difficult to establish, such as the case for the Pama-Nyungan languages \citep{Miceli2015}. The sound correspondences are few, and the languages present very little phonological differentiation, as noted by \citet[pp. 717]{Miceli2015}. This little phonological differentiation "is inconsistent with the number of potential cognates that can be found" \citep[pp. 717]{Miceli2015}. The difficulty of applying the comparative method in some languages gives us reason to explore other methods for investigating the history of the language and its speakers.

Other methods have been used to infer the historical relationships of languages, such as Lexicostatistics or Linguistic Phylogenetics. Lexicostatistics, developed by \citep{Swadesh1950}, uses percentages of shared vocabulary to establish relationships. This method initially was used in establishing the Pama-Nyungan family \citep[pp. 704]{Miceli2015}. Lexicostatistics as a method of establishing relationships by its own merit has fallen out of favour with most linguists, but classifications based on it are still in use (such as Pama-Nyungan). Linguistic Phylogenetics is a computational method adapted from evolutionary sciences \citep{BenHamed2015}. This methodology is used to recover phylogenetic signals from within the languages, based on comparative method data, and has been used in Pama-Nyungan linguistics to propose the historical branching of the Pama-Nyungan languages \citep{BowernAtkinson2012, BouckaertBowernAtkinson2018}. \citet[pp. 707]{Miceli2015} notes that this phylogenetic analysis is done based on the /assumption/ that the Pama-Nyungan languages are indeed related. This method identifies shared lexical innovations with a stochastic Dollo model; a maximum parsimony model in which characters (cognates) can be gained only once and not regained if lost \citep{Redei2008, NichollsGrey2008}. These shared lexical innovations are used to group languages into a phylogenetic tree, similar to the grouping of the comparative method \citep[pp. 707]{Miceli2015}.
*** Identifying Language Contact
Another of modelling bilingual driven language divergence is the potential for its use for investigating speaker interactions between language groups in history. In cases where written records do not exist, the shared history of interaction between groups of people requires other forms of evidence. Material archaeological evidence and oral history are likely to be the two that are currently considered for providing evidence of interaction between groups of people. The anti-doppel bias effect could be useful in positing possible connections between speaker groups. Where we have groups speaking language varieties that are assumed to be genetically related, if we can see greater than expected divergence (e.g. by observing significant differences between it and neighbouring languages) of the lexicon it may be indicative of a proportion of bilingual speakers in the populations. In turn, bilinguals would indicate some level of mutual contact between the groups of speakers. We can use simulation methodology to propose levels of bilingualism between the groups and compare the simulation results to the actual data.

** Victoria
The area of interest in this thesis is the area within the boundaries of the present-day Australian state of Victoria. This particular region is of interest due to this thesis' part in a larger interdisciplinary project.

The state is home to numerous indigenous groups, with a variety of languages. Both the languages and the indigenous nations of this area have varying degrees of documentation, with some areas of almost no documentation at all. Many accounts rely on data collected by amateur ethnographers and linguists in the late 1800s and early 1900s, such as \citet{Howitt1904, Howitt1880, Dawson1881, Matthews1904, Smyth1878} among others. There tends to be confusion about the general situation in the area of Victoria, with particular issues in areas in the West \citep{Madden2018}and far east of the region \citep{Hercus1969}.

*** Languages and territories in indigenous Victoria
The study also includes the surrounding border areas, with some languages inside the borders of New South Wales and South Australia. The area that we consider includes a data set (CHIRILA) containing 34 Geospatial areas, which roughly correspond to the areas ascribed to tribes in Tindale's  /Aboriginal Tribes Of Australia/ \citep{TindaleTribes1970}. There are some exceptions to the correspondences, with some areas not being as described in Tindale's work or absent entirely. Tindale's work lists 40 tribal areas (including those on the border with NSW and SA), under a variety of names and alternatives \citep[pp. 203-209]{TindaleTribes1970}. Sources of documentation about the languages in Victoria have some conflicting information regarding the relationship between languages and the relationships to speaker groups. Blake and Reid for example, recognise 11 'languages', with some having significant internal diversity \citep{BlakeRiedColac1998}. This classification is based on lexicostatistical data and the languages recognised each share no more than 50% of their attested vocabulary with any other 'language' \citep[pp. 4]{BlakeRiedColac1998}. This classification doesn't include some languages that are included in this study due to them being somewhat within the borders of Victoria, with \citet{BlakeRiedColac1998} noting particularly "Yitha-Yitha and Dardi-Dardi in the north-west, Bidawal in the east and Ngarigu in the north-east.", which are "sharply differentiated from any of the eleven languages that are included" \citep{BlakeRiedColac1998}. \citet[pp. 7]{Clark1996} lists 30 languages wholly within Victoria, and 6 "Marginal Language Groups" with most of their attributed territories within South Australia of New South Wales. 7 of these have internal Dialects listed.

\citet{Dixon1980} specifies lexical similarity criteria for the establishment of languages in his set of languages, in which dialects share 70% of vocabulary, and close-genetic relationships have between 60-70% of vocabulary shared, and genetically distant languages share 40% or less of their vocabularies. Dixon's criteria would conflict with the two aforementioned sources from \citet{Clark1996} and \citet{BlakeRiedColac1998}. Dixon's criteria also do not directly correlate to the lexicostatistical classification from \citet{OGVV1966}.

Dixon aptly notes that "The boundary between two languages will always run along a tribal boundary; but not every tribal boundary is a language boundary" \citep[pp. 37]{Dixon1980}. Dixon also claims that each local group within the larger tribal grouping "will as a rule speak a slightly different dialect from each other local group" \citep[pp. 38]{Dixon1980}. Therefore it stands to reason that for the boundaries considered in this study, there would exist some level of differentiation not being captured by the assumptions made, or there would be a differentiation made where potentially only a minor one exists. The situation, suffice to say, is one that is complex, meaning one of the primary assumptions - that language boundaries align with tribal boundaries - is not likely to fully capture the reality of the situation in as clear detail we would like. This assumption has been made only to simplify the modelling with the data that we have to work with. The areas coloured on the map below (Figure [[fig:viclang]]) show the boundaries we are investigating, within Australia.

* The Model Program
This chapter introduces the model program that is used to run the simulations in this thesis. This Chapter details the specific considerations and assumptions went into extending the Model from \citet{EllisonMiceli2017}. The model is Agent-Based and is comprised of Agents and an Environment. The rules for the interactions between agents and the effect that the environment has on these agents is detailed, such that the reader can understand what goes into these simulations. This section also presents a number of simulations previously run by \citet{EllisonMiceli2017}, in order to demonstrate the validity of this implementation of the cognitive model, and show that the changes made in the implementation do not affect the results. The full source code of the implementation, written in Python3, is available at the following GitHub web-page: https://github.com/Byndon/Bilingual-Divergence-Honours.

** The Agents
An Agent-Based Model needs agents, which make decisions and interact with each other and their environment. These Agents represent speakers of languages in our simulation. In order behave as modelled speakers, the speaker-agents have a number of properties which are designed to be representative of the properties of human speech which are important to the results of the mathematical description of the model from \citet{EllisonMiceli2017}. To this end agents are defined with a number of important attributes that are required by the model, but also are abstract representations of speakers and thus we should be aware of a number of limitations and incongruities when comparing the behaviour of actual speakers and their model representations.

*** The properties of Agents
A high-level overview of /what/ an Agent in this model is, is that an Agent is the portion of the Model which is responsible for the production of forms based on the frequencies defined by the languages in its set of known languages. Psycholinguistics studies provide evidence for the effect of frequency on word production time and frequency \citep{OldfieldWingfield1965, Rubenstein1970, Dell1990, GriffinBock1998, Garlock2001, Alario2002} for human speakers, ensuring that this overview of the role of speaker agents is appropriate. Thus the behaviours of the Agents are based on the the observed behaviour of human speakers. The behaviour of agents models the behaviour of individuals for the purpose of making the whole model as realistic as possible. However, making the model as realistic as possible must be balanced against making the model overly complicated, "as overly complicated models are more difficult to analyse" \citep[pp. 152]{eberlenscholzandgagliolo2017}. Our model is primarily intended to realistically model the observed behaviour of bilingual speakers, based on their /bilingual mode/ and how strictly they are monitoring their output \citep{EllisonMiceli2017}.

Each unique Agent possess a set of languages as their /Language Repertoire/. The /Language Repertoire/ defines which of the language objects in the program they have access to for the purposes of  production; for real speakers this is the set of languages for which they are capable of speaking. Agents have a defined /Native Language/ (L1) which is the language of the community that they inhabit. A language consists of a variety of /meanings/, each of which have one or more /forms/ which can be used to express that meaning. The frequency of each form that is used to express a particular meaning is stored as part of this language object.

Unlike their multilingual human counterparts an agent's languages are the set of languages which they display a similar level of proficiency in, rather than possessing a "Dominant" language as is typical of bilinguals, "because few bilinguals are genuinely balanced in their use of two languages" \citep[pp. 169]{KrollDussias2006}. \citet[58]{Grosjean2012} finds that "greater language proficiency helps a bilingual speaker avoid intrusions in a production task. Since speakers are (usually) more proficient in their L1, it follows that more monolingual levels of language mode can be achieved in a speaker’s L1 than in their L2. The more balanced the bilingual, the less true this will be due to a smaller gap in proficiency between L1 and L2." \citep[pp. 266]{EllisonMiceli2017}. This decision has been made due to simplicity for the model. Including some kind of proficiency calculation to affect the probability distribution of producing forms in addition to the current mathematical model will increase the complexity of the model and might have effects on the rate of change.

Agents have an individual Mode parameter and an individual Monitoring parameter meaning that these /can/ be set on a per-agent basis. The simulations presented in this thesis have been run in a such a way that ensures all agents will have the same Mode and Monitoring parameters, with these individual parameters being given global values. The Mode and Monitoring parameter values are not necessarily consistent in separate simulations, when considering the effects of specific Mode and Monitoring parameters. As the design of the Agents is intended to model an individual, it seemed reasonable to define these properties for each individual agent. The uniformity of these parameters make the model outcomes more predictable based on the expected results from the simulations in \citep{EllisonMiceli2017}. However, this decision clearly imposes a limitation on the model that prevents it from modelling the nuances of the "real-world" data. The reported best-fit Mode and Monitoring parameters from \citet[272]{EllisonMiceli2017} are those which have been fitted for a particular type of community.  In \citet{EllisonMiceli2017} the participants have particular bilingual configurations of Dutch and English, assessed in a lab setting which is intended to demonstrate the existence of the anti-doppel bias. In reality an individual's bilingual Mode is reliant on a variety of factors (see Background Section [[Language Mode]])

What may be a reasonable compromise between predictability and individuality of parameters, is that each agent's mode and monitoring parameters are a function of the number of speakers with similar linguistic configurations to themselves that exist in their immediate environment, i.e. their /Community/ (see below). The model can provide this functionality, but it is only partially implemented. This functionality is not based on evidence of how an individual's mode is decided, and so it has not been used for this thesis.

As mentioned above, agents have a /Community/. This is intended to be analogous to a "real-world" community, and is a grouping of speakers based on their location in the network. Communities are the objects that dictate where speakers are in the network structure. Communities have a language which is considered the community language, the configuration of which is unique to the specific community-language pair. All the agents within a community will share this community language, and when they are producing forms, this is the language that will be the target language in which they are attempting to produce forms. While communities are primarily meant to invoke ideas of a community located in a distinct and separate space from others, it can also be used to represent a single speech community. In this scenario the network nodes represent the target languages for groups of speakers. Each agent is still organised beneath a node in the network, but which node they are organised under indicates which language they intend to communicate in. 

These are the basic properties that define an agent as a representation of a "real-world" speaker. These agents have many dissimilarities to a real-world speaker, some of which will be considered here for their potential impacts when comparing the real-world to the simulated world. This is a speculative attempt to discuss the possible ramifications of the simulation not being a 1:1 duplication of the real world (or of real speakers in an artificial laboratory environment), which obviously would be impractical to attempt.

Speaker Agents in this simulation behave as if the production each member of their community has an equal effect on their own production the next time they go to speak (at each generation or step of the model). There are no internal social groupings affecting form frequency, there is no age-graded frequencies of forms as observed in real world data, or other socially dependant properties which would be informative for a finer-grained approach to the problem of deciding language change on the basis of a frequency-affected bias.

Speaker agents make an effort to only communicate in the native language of the community, i.e their target language is always the language which is both understood and can be produced by every other agent in the community. As such, the multilingual language practices like those of the Warruwi community in Northern Australia \citep{Singer2018} are not represented in this model.

Agents, and thus their language repertoires, are fixed at the point of initialisation. The program does not model any form of language acquisition or transmission due to this. Even though the frequencies with which forms occur evolve throughout time, the agents that produce them and their repertoires do not. 


** The Environment
The environment which the agents inhabit consists of two components: the Community and the Network.

As mentioned above, all agents are part of a Community. This is intended to be analogous to a "real-world" community, and is primarily intended to be thought of as a grouping of speakers based on their location in space relative to each other. Communities can have a varying number of agents contained within. They do not have to all have the same population of speakers, however for the simulations in this thesis we have chosen 50 agents. This decision was made based on the observation from \citep[pp. 43]{Dixon1980} "it appears that the size of Australian tribes ranged from a few hundred to a thousand or so, distributed around a mean figure of 500". We took this figure and scaled down to save computational resources.

Communities are the objects that dictate where speakers are in the network structure, which in turn dictates the possible languages that can exist in their repertoire. The community which contains any particular agent limits the potential languages in the agent's repertoire, as speaker agents only speak a language other than the community language if the community that speaks that other language is adjacent to their community in the network structure. Adjacency is a property of two vertices in a network, where the vertices are said to be adjacent if and only if they are connected by an edge. Below, \textsc{a} and \textsc{b}, as well as \textsc{b} and \textsc{c} are adjacent pairs, but \textsc{a} and \textsc{c} are not adjacent. Consider Figure [[fig:adjacent]].

#+NAME: fig:adjacent
#+CAPTION[Adjacent Nodes]: The Nodes \textsc{a}, \textsc{b}, and \textsc{c} represent Communities of speakers, with the Edges between them representing contact between these communities.
#+ATTR_LATEX: :scale 1 :float nil
[[./diagrams/non-adjacent.png]]

Thus, community \textsc{a} can have speakers who are bilingual in the language of community \textsc{b} and /vice versa/, \textsc{b} can have speakers who are bilingual in the language of \textsc{a} or \textsc{c} and /vice versa/, but \textsc{a} cannot have bilinguals in the language of \textsc{c} and /vice versa/. 

Communities have a language which is considered the community language, the configuration of which is unique to the specific community-language pair. All the agents within a community will share this community language, and when they are producing forms, this is the language that will be the target language from which they attempt to produce forms. The important part of the specific community language pair is that languages are maintained on a community-by-community basis, rather than in the minds of speaker agents. This has a number of implications for the linguistic scenario modelled herein.

Firstly, any number of languages can be initialised with the same starting forms and frequencies, and the speaker will still consider them to be separate languages due to the fact that they are from different communities. This means that the model of speakers perception of languages as different from each other is heightened, even if they are similar languages overall. This means that communities are considered by speakers to have associated identities, and perceive their languages differently even if the differences are minor. This means that when developing the scenarios which are being given to the model, it is assumed that two languages being spoken in two separate communities are either perceptibly different, or are separated by community identity (cf. Serbian and Croatian for contemporary examples).

Due to the fact that languages are defined objects which speaker agents are familiar with rather than an internalisation of a particular method of communicating for each agent, the agent's perceptions of what are and are not separate languages are fixed at the beginning of the simulation. This means that even if two languages were to converge to become identical for some reason, the agents that are bilinguals in those languages, which are equal in all but name and the community to which they are assigned, will still consider them to be different languages. Obviously such a situation would occur in this model when monitoring is low and bilingual mode is high. In this case all doppel forms are facilitated to become the dominant forms used to express their associated meanings. Individual speakers still consider the language of their direct neighbour to be different from their own.

Secondly, this means that each agent with the same linguistic repertoire and same target language (e.g. two agents each speaking language 1 and language 2, in the community of language 1) will be producing forms with identical probabilities. This has been used to increase the speed of the program, avoiding unnecessary calculations of probabilities when speakers are essentially identical. However, this does mean that there is no individual variation within speakers of a community that share the same repertoire.

Whether or not the implications of how languages and communities interact with speakers are reasonable, the model has been designed in this way to facilitate development and also to use fewer computational resources when executed, as having each agent maintain its own internal representations of all the languages it speaks is very resource intensive (maintaining hundreds or thousands of these structures in the computer's memory), or very slow to execute e.g. in recomputing the probabilities of producing each form for every agent.

While communities are primarily meant to invoke ideas of a community located in a distinct and separate space from others, it can also be used to represent a single speech community. In this scenario the network vertices represent the target languages for groups of speakers. Each agent is still organised beneath a vertex in the network, but which node they are organised under indicates which language they intend to communicate in.  So each agent within a vertex, \textsc{a}, will intend to communicate in the language defined by \textsc{a}, and any agent within a vertex, \textsc{b}, will intended to communicate in the language defined by \textsc{b}. 

The bilinguals in this model speaking the language of their surrounding communities means that they internalise the frequencies of forms from that language. The bilinguals therefore, do not have any language which is divergent from that of the community which has native speakers of that language. Both a native speaker and a second language speaker will produce forms in that language based on the same frequencies. Speakers are modelled as being highly fluent in all languages of their repertoire.

The Network is the structure that organises the Communities based on their connections to other communities. The network vertices are the community objects that group agents together. The edges in the network are the links between communities that dictate which languages bilinguals can speak. The number of bilingual speakers that are present in a community from another connected community is directly proportional to the weight of the edge connecting the two communities in question. Given two communities /A/ and /B/, an edge linking them with a weight of 0.5 in an undirected network will result in 50% of the speakers in /A/ will speak the language of /B/, and /B/ will have 50% of its speakers bilingual in the language of /A/, rounded down. If a community has a connection to another community, a percentage of the speaker agents in the community are chosen at random without replacement to be bilingual in the connected community's language. For each subsequent connection, speaker agents are replaced, and then drawn randomly without replacement from the population. So, for the community connections defined by a 3-vertex path network (such as that in the previous figure), the central vertex in the network will have a percentage of bilingual speakers of the languages adjacent to it. As each speaker agent in the simulation /must/ speak the language of the community it inhabits, speakers of this central vertex may be monolingual in the community language, bilingual in one of the adjacent languages, or (because agents are replaced when considering a new adjacent vertex) trilingual in the community language and the languages of both adjacent communities.
** What occurs when the model runs?
The full details of the model and its functionality are available for those want to read the program files, but an overview of the function of the model is required to have an idea of considerations and assumptions made when running these simulations. 

*** How initialisation works
In order to run the model, the relevant parameters, network structures, and agents must all be set up with initial values. The model must be initialised with:
- A number of communities, presented as vertices in a network, with a unique name provided for each. \This number does not change during the course of a simulation.
- The connections between communities, presented as edges in a network, either directed or undirected.  These are also constant within any singular run of the simulation.
- A number of languages equal to the number of communities, with unique names. Unique names are not necessary for the program to run, but the output may be confusing if they are not unique.
- The number of Agents that will be created within each community. We keep the number of agents constant across simulation runs.
- A bilingual mode parameter. The mode used in this thesis is the same for each agent, but can be set per-agent.
- A monitoring parameter. Similarly to the mode parameter, this is fixed for this thesis, but can be applied separately to individual agents.
- A network weight parameter. The parameter is the same for each network edge in the simulations in this thesis, but can be set individually for each network edge.

First in the process of initialising the model, communities are populated based on the supplied population information for each. In this process a number of agents are created for the communities, and their L1 is set to be the language of the community they are inhabiting. At this point the agents are given a mode parameter and monitoring parameter. This parameter can be assigned for each of the agents individually, or can be a standard mode and monitoring provided to all agents in the simulation. The simulations in this thesis are the type that use fixed, universal mode and monitoring parameters. The created agents are then assigned to the community for which they are created.

Secondly to initialise the model, the process of creating bilingual speakers is carried out. To create bilingual speakers in a community, each of the community's adjacent vertices is considered one at a time. When an adjacent vertex is considered, the weight of the edge between the two vertices is used to determine the amount of speaker agents that will be bilingual in the language of the adjacent community. The weight is representative of a percentage of the population which will speak the language in addition to their current repertoire (initially a single language; that of the community their current community). For any agent in community \textsc{c}, it has probability */p/* of speaking language \textsc{d}, if the connection weight between \textsc{c} and \textsc{d} is */p/*. These opportunities for bilingualism are independent of each other. In practice, this means a speaker can potentially speak an number of languages up to the number of connections to its community \textsc{c} (the /degree/[fn:10] of the node) plus the native language of \textsc{c}.

The third step in initialising the model is to set up the meanings that can be expressed and the forms which they can be expressed by. As noted above (regarding the properties of agents), /Languages/ are collections of /Meanings/ which are linked with /Forms/ and their frequency data. The frequency data only relates to how frequently a particular form is used to express a particular meaning. The frequency of meanings is uniform, such that each meaning is equally likely to be expressed by an agent. This is obviously not entirely congruent with one's own experience, as not all meanings are expressed at equal frequency. This is done for simplicity's sake in the model, as there is no need for this added complexity in this model. Additionally, frequency of meanings expressed is very contextual, and for a simulation intended to determine patterns of diachronic change such differences in frequency are be assumed to even out over the longer time period.

From this point the model is initialised with the parameters required to commence stepping through the simulation, such that intermediary results between the initialisation and the final state of the forms and frequencies are calculated.

*** Stepping the model
The behaviour of the model as it evolves through time is determined by on the actions of agents "speaking" in order to produce forms. Speaker agents each have a repertoire of languages, which may or may not be unique in their community, which determine of the probability of producing each form in each meaning. In order to prevent the unnecessary re-computation of these probability distributions, speaker agents will determine firstly if the specific linguistic configuration that they may share has already been computed. Assuming it has not, they will then randomly choose 100 meanings to produce with replacement, 100 samples per agent per step in \citet[275]{EllisonMiceli2017}.

Due to doppel forms being determined only by the fact that they are the same form and meaning within a bilingual's linguistic faculties, any forms present in multiple languages are merged into a single form that is activated by each of the languages that it is associated with. The frequencies of these doppel forms are averaged across the bilinguals languages. So, if a speaker is bilingual and a form, /kuramu/, for the meaning /'Possum'/ is present in their native language with a frequency of 60%, and present in their additional language for the same meaning with a frequency of 75%, the overall frequency of that form for the speaker will be the mean average of those two frequencies 67.5%.

Now that the forms for each have been collected together to represent the forms that appear in each of the speaker's languages. For each of these forms for the specific meaning the agent will calculate the probability that they will produce that form, given the meaning they are intending to produce, and their Mode and Monitoring parameters. The mathematical model used is an implementation of that detailed in \citet{EllisonMiceli2017}.

Once they have calculated the probability that they will produce each of the forms for their intended meaning, they will choose a form probabilistically from the probability distribution, such that forms more likely to be produced will be produced more often, but there is still a chance to produce less-likely forms.

For each of the 100 meanings that were initially sampled for the agent to express, this same process of combining doppel forms and calculating the probabilities of producing each given the agent's constraints is carried out, such that 100 forms are produced for each agent.

For each of the forms produced, the next step is to determine whether or not their production has an effect on the frequency of the form in the target language, i.e. the language of the agent's community. If the form produced for a meaning is present in the target language for that meaning, that form will increase a tally which keeps track of the number of times that form was produced within a step of the model. The production of forms which are not present in the target language does not increase the frequency of that form in the target (as there is no corresponding entry in the target for it to increase), and also does not increase the frequency of use in any other language. Frequency increase of a form is localised to the specific community in which the target language is spoken. So an agent in community \textsc{a} which intends to produce a form in language \textsc{a}, but fails and produces a form present in language \textsc{b} from their repertoire, will not increase the frequency of use of either language \textsc{a}, as there is no form to increase, or language \textsc{b}, as the change in language \textsc{b} is localised to inhabitants of community \textsc{b}. This intends to model a community being in charge of what is considered to be the language that belongs to it. The majority of speakers of language \textsc{b} will, in most circumstances, inhabit community \textsc{b}, so the effect of one producing a form in language \textsc{b} will be relatively unnoticed by members of community \textsc{b} and thus have a negligible effect on the frequency in that language.

After every agent has been sampled for the 100 forms it produces, the tally of the number of uses of each form in each language are used to update the frequency of those forms. Take a meaning in a language with 3 forms where a form /i/ is counted 100 times, a second form /j/ is counted 50 times, and a form /k/ is counted 25 times. With this distribution of tallies, the form /i/ will have a frequency of ~57%, the form /j/ will have a frequency of ~28.5%, and form /k/ will have a frequency of ~14.3%. These newly determined form frequencies are then used for calculations on the subsequent step of the model.

The model will run this sequence for a number of steps or generations specified, with the frequencies of forms in each language varying according to the actions of the speaker agents in the model.

** Validating the Model against Ellison and Miceli 2017
To determine whether the model defined in the program gives the results as we would expect from the model from \citet{EllisonMiceli2017}, we will compare the results of simulations as defined in \citet[274-275]{EllisonMiceli2017} to the results of this program when given the same parameters and starting conditions. All the Agent-Based Simulations from Ellison and Miceli are run with a Bilingual Mode parameter of 54% (0.54), and a Monitoring parameter of 100% (1.0), meaning bilinguals are "less likely to use a doppel than monolinguals" \citep[pp. 274]{EllisonMiceli2017}, with each simulation being run for 35 steps with a total of 100 agents each being sampled for their produced output 100 times \citep[pp. 275]{EllisonMiceli2017}. In order to differentiate the Doppel forms on the graph, one language has the doppel initial frequency of 55% and the other has a doppel initial frequency of 50%.

*** Simulation 10a
Simulation 10a \citep[pp. 275]{EllisonMiceli2017} simulates a scenario with no bilingual speakers in the population, and so both languages exhibit "only slow, random change in relative frequency" \citep[pp. 275]{EllisonMiceli2017}. In order to recreate this in our program, which has only one language spoken in each community, creating an equivalent community (100 agents with 0 bilingualism) would be modelled as two communities with a undirected network edge connection between these two community vertices with a weight of 0. Doing this gives 2 communities with no bilinguals between the two languages. As the community determines each speaker's target language, to see effects in 2 languages there must be two community vertices, as in Figure [[fig:10a]] below:

Running this simulation and graphing the results following \citet[275]{EllisonMiceli2017}, results in the following graph in Figure [[fig:10agraph]]:

*** Simulation 10b
Simulation 10b \citep[pp. 275]{EllisonMiceli2017} simulates an asymmetrical situation, where one group of speakers is entirely bilingual, and the group has around 50% monolingual speakers. To recreate this network, 2 community vertices are again used due to the design of the program, this time in a directed network structure, such that one of the vertices will contain 100% bilinguals, and the other will contain 50% bilinguals. The structure of this network is presented below in Figure [[fig:10b]].

Running this simulation and graphing the results results in the graph seen in Figure [[fig:10bgraph]] below:

#+CAPTION[Doppel Frequency 10b]: Simulation 10b simulates a community with asymmetrical bilingualism. The Doppel form in L2, node /a/ in figure, undergoes a rapid decrease in frequency, resulting in the doppel being lost in the language. The Doppel form in L1, node /b/ in figure, undergoes a less rapid bias against it for a number of steps, but once the Doppel form is lost in L2, the form is no longer a doppel, and thus the bias ceases.

*** Simulation 10c
The third simulation, 10c, is an example of a symmetrically bilingual community, with 50% of the total community being bilingual. To replicate this community, a undirected 2 vertex network is used, with a weight between the vertices of 0.5. The network diagram below, Figure [[fig:10c]], illustrates the structure of this network:

#+CAPTION[Network 10c]: The Network Diagram equivalent of the community present in simulation 10c from \citep[pp. 275]{EllisonMiceli2017}.

Running this simulation and graphing the results gives Figure [[fig:10cgraph]] below:

#+CAPTION[Doppel Frequency 10c]: Simulation 10c simulates a community of speakers, 50% of which are bilinguals. The bias affects each language, but as the frequency of the Doppel in L2 decreases, the bias against the doppel form in L1 diminishes, slowing the change in frequency.
#+NAME: fig:10cgraph
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil
[[./10cgraph.png]]

Compared to the resultant graphs from \citet[275]{EllisonMiceli2017}, the same behaviour (with some variation due to the inherently stochastic processes of the model) can be seen between the two models. Due to the similarities observed, the results from the simulations that are run with this program are likely to be the results that we would expect if we gave similar information to the original simulations on which this is based. Thus it is expected that the effects on the frequencies of Doppels and alternative non-doppel forms are what would be expected from communities of speakers exhibiting an anti-doppel bias diachronically.
* Simulations
Agent based simulations are a method of observing how a community reacts to the actions of many individuals acting according to defined rules. As we are aware, there is a notable effect of doppel avoidance from bilingual  individuals, as attested in \citet[pp. 270]{EllisonMiceli2017} in which "Bilinguals showed consistently less frequent use of Doppels than monolinguals". They used simulations to investigate the diachronic effect of this bias. They showed that this weak but statistically significant bias displayed by bilingual speakers has the potential to impact the frequency of use of doppel forms over time, when speakers' production follows the mathematical model they describe in the same paper \citep[pp. 257-268]{EllisonMiceli2017}.

The simulations presented in Ellison and Miceli's work are intended to demonstrate that these simple individual decisions can affect a linguistic system, and accomplish this task elegantly. However, exploring the potential for language differentiation and diffusion over larger areas, with many speakers, multiple languages, and more complex patterns of multilingualism, is the goal of the simulations described in this thesis.

The program used to simulate scenarios has been described previously, as well as some general considerations about its limitations and its inherent assumptions. This section  will  detail each simulated scenario. It will also analyse the results of each. Simulations have previously been run comparing the model against the output of the 3 agent-based simulations in \citet{EllisonMiceli2017}, confirming the validity of the current implementation.

Networks can be classified as directed networks (digraphs) or undirected networks (graphs). Both types were used in simulations. Undirected networks are the simpler case, where patterns of bilingualism are symmetrical in both communities connected by the network edge. Directed networks are used in situations where asymmetrical bilingual habitation needs to be modelled. We consider the symmetrical scenario here, where bilingual speakers are distributed evenly in communities.

** 2 Node Network Structures
The 2 node network structure (Figure [[fig:2node]]) it the structure used previously to validate the model against those from \citet[pp. 274-275]{EllisonMiceli2017}. The interactions between communities in this network are simple; speakers can be at most bilingual, and both communities have an equal number of speakers who can speak the other community's language. In this way, both communities should have the same initial pressures acting on what their speakers' produce. These scenarios also use a single meaning with multiple forms to simplify the model's operation. With a single meaning the 100 samples from each agent are concentrated entirely on a single meaning, so the maximal effect on that meaning can be seen. We seed the languages of the 2 node network with a single shared doppel and a unique form for each of the two languages. Speaker behaviour varies with a number of parameters, including mode and monitoring, bilingual speaker proportion (dictated by network weight), and the effects of different form frequencies in the initial state.

[[./diagrams/twoout.png]]

*** The effect of Mode and Monitoring combinations
The effects of the anti-doppel bias are, as the name suggests, most easily seen in the frequency of shared doppel forms between two languages. We know from \citet[pp. 274-275]{EllisonMiceli2017} simulations that the combination of these two parameters results in a bias of varying strengths for some combinations, and in others results in a facilitatory effect on doppel forms.



#+CAPTION[Mode and Monitoring Effect]: Low = 25%, High = 75%
#+NAME: fig:highlow
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil :scale 0.45
[[./diagrams/modemoneffect.png]]

This model has a 2 node network, with full bilingualism in each community. We explore combinations of High and Low Mode and Monitoring parameters. The average relative frequency of the doppel form across both languages is graphed against the model step. The model was run for 35 steps (or generations), starting with the initial form and frequency parameters at step 0.

The doppel frequency begins high, at two-thirds of the usage in each language, in order to emphasise the effect of the bias as the most probable outcome of these combinations. The effects are described by \citet[pp. 267]{EllisonMiceli2017} thus; "more monitoring leads to a lower likelihood for Doppels, while a higher language mode makes them more likely", These results are clearly visible figure [[fig:highlow]] above. Overall, combining high  Mode and Monitoring will generally result in a decrease of doppel forms in languages with a sufficient bilingual population.

As can be observed all but the high Bilingual Mode, low Monitoring scenario result in a decrease in the frequency of the doppel form. Interestingly for the two extreme cases, the High Mode and Low Monitoring situation, in which we would expect facilitation of doppels, and the Low Mode and High Monitoring situation, in which we would expect a strong anti-doppel bias, the relative time for the two processes to achieve their end states, a completely dominant doppel form, and the complete loss of the doppel form respectively, is different. The facilitation effect is slower, taking 18 steps to be almost entirely dominant (above 99%), while the bias against the doppel causes it to be almost completely eliminated in only 13 steps (less than 1%). The facilitation also doesn't completely eliminate the competing forms until the 35th step, where the doppel is removed by the 24th step.

*** The effects of bilingual speaker population as a proportion of the total population.
These Mode and Monitoring parameter combinations used 2 fully bilingual communities to increase the rate of change in the average relative frequency of the doppel form. So what happens if there are fewer bilingual speakers in the communities?



#+CAPTION[Effect of Bilingual Proportion]: A more bilingual population affects amount of time the bias takes to complete. Fewer bilinguals means this bias is slower to complete.
#+NAME: fig:bilingualeffect
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil :scale 0.35
[[./diagrams/bilingualeffect.png]]

If we graph the doppel frequencies, using the best fit Mode and Monitoring parameters from Ellison and Miceli (2017:272) - 54% mode and 100% monitoring - and vary the bilingual proportion the general effect of the proportion of bilinguals can be observed. Generally, the higher the proportion of bilinguals in the population, the faster the doppel forms decline, as seen in graph [[fig:bilingualeffect]].


#+CAPTION[Absolute Change in Doppel Frequency]: Graphing absolute change in the relative frequency of the doppel form. Larger segments of the bar indicate larger absolute changes in the average frequency between two languages.
#+NAME: fig:bargraph
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil 
[[./diagrams/changeinpercentbi.png]]
We see that the overall change occurs more quickly with a higher proportion of bilinguals in each community. Large changes in overall frequency occur early in the simulation, tapering off rapidly as the doppel form tends to zero frequency (cf. 100% bilingual population in graph [[fig:bargraph]]), and lower levels of bilingualism show more consistent change between steps over the total run of the simulation (cf. 10% bilingual population in graph [[fig:bargraph]]).

*** Measuring Divergence due to the anti-doppel bias.
The loss of shared forms is one kind of divergence between languages. The language's vocabularies become less similar as the non-doppel forms become more frequent due to bilingual speaker's preference for non-doppels being adopted by the whole community over time. Languages in this model become more diverse, but how can the diversity of vocabulary forms within and between languages be measured? Entropy is a measure of uncertainty or variance, which we will use for measuring the variability within language meanings and between languages. Entropy has been used to measure language diversity in other research \citep{UNESCO, Titone, levitin1994}. A more variable system is one where you are less likely to be able to predict the resultant form that a speaker will produce for any particular meaning. In the case of the model these have higher entropy than those with more predictable choices. Completely predictable systems - those with no variability - have 0 entropy. Entropy is calculated by the equation:

$H(X)=-\sum_{x\in{X}}p_x\cdot \log_2(p_x`)$ \citep[pp. 614]{ShannonEntropy}. 

Looking at the languages in the same 2 node structure, we can calculate the entropy of each language to measure how ordered the internal linguistic system (the forms) is. The evolution of the entropy of each system over time is affected by the amount of bilinguals and the Mode and Monitoring Parameters.

**** The effect of bilingual population proportion

The situation vary the proportion of bilingual Speakers and constant mode and monitoring parameters. In graph [[fig:bilingualvariance]] we can see the effect the bilingual speakers have on the amount of variance that we have in the two languages on average.


#+CAPTION[Bilingual proportion effect on lexical variability]: Varying bilingual proportions within the two communities affects the variance of the languages. More bilinguals result in more varied languages initially, but over time the variance lowers due to the anti-doppel bias resulting in doppels being lost. 
#+NAME: fig:bilingualvariance
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil :scale 0.45
[[./diagrams/aventropy2langs.png]]

Situations in which frequencies of the doppel form decrease rapidly show a significant increase in entropy. They becoming more variable early on, as the form frequencies (which started as equal frequency) begin to be altered by both the anti-doppel bias, and the effect of differing form frequency on production for the monolinguals. As the simulation progresses, there is a tendency for the entropy to decrease from the initial entropy. Situations where bilinguals are a higher proportion of the population progress towards their final (lower) entropy in fewer steps than those with smaller bilingual populations. Notably, some entropy curves do not appear to follow the general pattern, where higher speaker proportion is correlated with lower total frequency after the 35 steps of the model. In the case of the fully bilingual population, the entropy of the two languages' forms is higher than that of the half-bilingual population. If we plot the frequency of the forms for each language in graph [[fig:formfreq]], we can see why this is the case:


#+CAPTION[2 Language Form Frequency]: The Frequency of forms in 2 languages. We see the doppels reduce in both languages, but with high enough proportion of bilinguals the doppel form is not lost in both languages. One loses the doppel faster, which results in the other bilingual speakers no longer experiencing a bias against that form.
#+NAME: fig:formfreq
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil :scale .45
[[./diagrams/comparefrequency.png]]

With 50% bilingual in each language, we can see that the doppel forms in both languages tend to 0 frequency, with a comparatively slow rate. The almost complete loss of the doppel in both languages, means that the two non-doppel forms are near 100% frequency, making the system less variable, and so we see a lower entropy.

In the community with a fully bilingual population, a faster change in frequency is observed, with the L2 doppel form dropping to 0 frequency faster than the L1 doppel. The loss of this doppel form in L1 means that the bias against that form ceases, as it is no longer present in both languages, so that bilinguals do not feel an anti-doppel bias. This results in a situation where L1 has only one form for the modelled meaning (less variable, lower entropy), and L2 retaining a second form with low frequency maintaining some variability resulting in higher entropy.

Therefore, the fully bilingual scenario has higher average entropy than the 50% bilingual scenario after the 35 steps.

Also of interest are the simulations with lower levels of bilingualism, 5% and 10%, which end the 35 steps with higher entropy then the average entropy of the forms at initialisation. While the 10% scenario is trending towards a lowering entropy, the 5% bilingual situation is still increasing by the end of the simulation run. The 5% bilingual situation does not begin to decrease within the scope of of the simulation run. Whether or not it decreases if the simulation were to run for more time is uncertain. As the frequency of the doppel tends downward, there is still clearly an anti-doppel bias effect, despite increasing entropy over the same period. This indicates that linguistic systems with fewer bilinguals will be more variable diachronically than those with more bilinguals over the same relative time period.

**** The effect of Mode and Monitoring parameters

Varying the Mode and Monitoring parameters affects the average entropy in two languages. Multilinguals speakers with high levels of activation of forms in both languages have different effects on the system depending on their level of monitoring, as shown in Figure [[fig:ModeMonEntropy]].


#+CAPTION[Mode and Monitoring effects on lexical variability]: All combinations of Mode and Monitoring cause the entropy to decrease. In most cases this is due to the doppel form being lost, but the high Mode, low Monitoring situation this is due to the languages converging on a shared form.
#+NAME: fig:ModeMonEntropy
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil :scale 0.45
[[./diagrams/aventropy2langsModeMon.png]]

Previously the relative slowness of the doppel facilitation effect compared to the anti-doppel bias has been noted. This is much more easily observed by measuring variance, where the situation in which a strong bias is expected (Low Mode and High Monitoring) drops to low levels of average entropy in fewer steps compared to the facilitation effect. The other scenarios, Low Mode and Low Monitoring and High Mode and High Monitoring, show a slow decrease in entropy as the bias against the doppel decreases the frequency of that form.

An increase of entropy from the start is only observed with highly bilingual speakers who are monitoring minimally, which is also the only scenario in which the frequency of the forms do not at some point converge, resulting in very similar frequency distributions. This is shown below in the graph of the average relative frequency of all the forms in each scenario (Graph [[fig:frequencyHighLow]]. The values of average form frequency are diverging. This causes the variance to increase initially, seen here in Figure [[fig:frequencyHighLow]].


#+CAPTION[Relative Frequency of Doppels Compared]: High mode and low monitoring is the only combination of parameters which leads to convergence of forms to the doppel.
#+NAME: fig:frequencyHighLow
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil :scale .4
[[./diagrams/frequencyHIGHLOWLOWHIGHinternalsquare.png]]


We can see that where there is a bias against a doppel form, the non-doppel forms will grow to be a larger part of the average relative frequency of forms in the two languages. The forms each tend towards 50% of productions (or 100% if considered individually) as the doppel form is lost due to the effects of the bilingual population. Where there is not a bias with high bilingual mode and negligible monitoring, the doppel form tends to 100% as the languages converge to share the doppel form.


** 3 Vertex Network Structure
The simulations involving 2 communities above give an idea of the effect of interactions between  communities on the languages that are spoken within them. However many languages share borders with multiple other languages or dialects. So these languages face more complicated interactions and these are useful to understand. We will again initialise languages with a doppel shared amongst all languages and a synonym unique to each language. The network structure is presented in Figure [[fig:3node]] below.

#+CAPTION[3 Node Network]: The simple 3-node network structure.
#+NAME: fig:3node
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil :scale 1
[[./diagrams/3out.png]]


The network above consists of 3 community vertices, with each having its own community language; the target language for its resident monolinguals and bilinguals alike. We are interested primarily in what occurs to the spatial distribution of forms among the communities. We can create the prerequisite language situation within the model, in order to see what the effects on the doppel forms in each language are. The bias against doppel forms, along with the results of previous simulations, indicates that doppel forms will be replace where there is 2-language interaction. We want to check that a situation in which we have 3-language communities will have similar results, with languages losing doppel forms in favour of unique synonyms. We graph the frequencies of these forms in Figure [[fig:3freq]].


#+CAPTION[Frequencie of doppel and non-doppel in 3 communities]: The 3 language configuration does behave similarly to the two language configuration. It loses the doppel forms in favour of the unique non-doppels in each language.
#+NAME: fig:3freq
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil
[[./diagrams/newfigure3.png]]

*** Multiple Doppels
We should also consider situations in which more than a single form is shared. The next simulation, graphed in Figure [[fig:3dopp]], has 3 languages with bilingual speakers. Non-doppel synonyms exist in all the languages, perhaps due to some prior diffusion between the languages. Later speakers began to monitor their output more closely. 


#+CAPTION[The effect of multiple doppels on variation]: Multiple doppels in each community causes more variation in the language as each slowly becomes distinct from its neighbours due to the actions of bilinguals affecting the whole community of speakers.
#+NAME: fig:3dopp
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil :scale .4
[[./diagrams/3doppel3community.png]]


Each form in this simulation was initialised at the same frequency in every community. The effect of the bias, however, soon becomes apparent. With a bilingual mode of 54% and monitoring at 100%, there is clearly some element of randomness present in which some form initially begins to become more common in each language. Each of the 3 forms remain relatively close in frequency for the first 5 or so steps in Language 1 and, similarly, in Language 2. But the early differentiation of the forms in Language 3 begins to drive down the prevalence of From 1 and Form 3 in that language. The gain in frequency of Form 1 in Language 1 picks up quickly, further driving it's prevalence down in the other languages as bilinguals begin to associate the form more with Language 1 than their own language. The interesting pattern occurs in Language 2 until around the 33rd step of the model. Both Form 2 and Form 3 are used at similar frequency up to this point. This is likely due to the speakers of this language being "caught out" for lack of a better term. The early randomness of the process results in increasing frequency to Form 2, continuing to increase until it becomes apparent to Language 2 bilinguals that Form 2 is more closely associated with speakers that they hear speaking one of their other languages. This results in speakers showing a bias against Form 2. Form 1 is much lower frequency by this point and bilinguals speaking Language 1 are already displaying the bias against this form, leaving Language 2 speakers to produce Form 3. Bilinguals monitoring their output avoid using shared vocabulary - as both a cause and effect of this change. Reaching a state where there are no synonym terms present in any of the languages takes much longer than with a 2 language scenario. It is not until the 88th step out of 100 that the last remnants of any synonyms are lost in Language 2. Calculating the Entropy of the forms in the languages at each step gives a good idea of the relative speed at which the languages 'specialise' to a single form, seen below in Figure [[fig:specialise]]. 


#+CAPTION[Variability in a 3 community network]: The total number of steps taken for the entropy of each language to reach the minimum shows how long the language had a variety of possible forms.
#+NAME: fig:specialise
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil :scale 0.5
[[./diagrams/33entropy.png]]

What is left, after 100 steps is 3 languages which no longer have the original doppel forms in common. Each language has adopted a form that differentiates it from the others that it is in contact with. There is a long period where synonym forms are still present in multiple languages in spite of the bias. Languages 2 and 3 have a lengthy period where they share 2 forms, albeit with differing frequency, with 49 steps occurring before either Form 2 or 3 falls below 10% frequency in Language 3. At the estimated time over which each 'step' in the model occurs - somewhere in the range of 5 to 10 years per step (Ellison and Miceli, personal communication, July 17, 2021) - the diachronic effect of this bias, is slow. The almost entirely subconscious process by which speakers produce these forms would mean that it is entirely likely that citable differences in vocabulary would not reach a speaker's conscious awareness for many generations. The passage so much time usually also brings sound change. In the Australian context however the restricted sound changes that we do see \citep[pp. 15]{Miceli2015} would likely have less effect on this than in most other areas.





** 5 Vertex Star Network Structure
This network has satellite language communities arranged around a central community. Each satellite is  in contact with the central community, but not in contact with any other. Historically this might be due to ceremonial relationship, or impassable terrain between the satellite groups, or even enmity between the satellite groups. The Network diagram below (Figure [[fig:starnet]]) demonstrates the structure of the network.
#+CAPTION[5 Node Star Network]: A 5 node network consisting of a single central node connected to 4 satellite nodes. Satellite nodes are not connected to each other.
#+NAME: fig:starnet
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil :scale 1
[[./diagrams/starout.png]]
In this simulation the Mode parameter is 54% and Monitoring 100%, with 20% bilingual weighting along each edge in the network. Two forms, /both/ of which are doppel, are initialised for each community, with 'Form 1' being significantly more frequent in each language; two-thirds of the total initial production. The two figures below show the frequency change for each form in the central node (Figure [[fig:centrefrequency]]) and the satellite nodes (Figure [[fig:satnodes]]).

#+CAPTION[Frequency of forms in central node]: The initially dominant doppel, Form 1 (blue), and the less frequently used doppel, Form 2 (orange), invert due to the anti-doppel bias.
#+NAME: fig:centrefrequency
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil
[[./diagrams/starcentralfrequency.png]]

$\newpage$
#+CAPTION[Frequency of forms in Satellite nodes]: The satellite languages all follow the same pattern of divergence. The dominant Form 1 (blue) increases its dominance, as the anti-doppel bias affects the other form More greatly due to it's prevalence in the central language.
#+NAME: fig:satnodes
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil :scale 0.45
[[./diagrams/starouterfreq.png]]

The frequency of each form in the above graphs shows that the central language loses its shared and most frequent 'Form 1' in favour of the lower frequency 'Form 2', while the satellite languages retain their most frequent form. This results from the greater proportion of bilinguals that are present in the central language due to the number of connections that it has. Around 20% of the population speaks at least one of the languages from each satellite community. With our 50 speaker populations for each language, when selecting our bilinguals for each language in contact we replace them after each satellite language's bilinguals are selected. 20% of 50 speakers is 10 bilingual speakers for each neighbouring language. Bilingual speakers can be chosen more than once, such that they become trilingual or more. Speakers in the central community have a  chance of being bilingual, a smaller chance of being trilingual, and so on. Due to more connections, the central language has a much higher proportion of bilinguals, who are biased /against/ the form that they associate frequently with their non-native community language. The satellite languages do not nearly have as much pressure against the shared form; their anti-doppel bias is less strong. Due to the increasing frequency of the less frequent form in the central language, the bias against this form grows in the satellite language communities, resulting in it's eventual loss. As both forms were initially doppels, this shows that the proportion of bilingual speakers in the language is far more important than the initial frequencies of the forms. A high frequency doppel form can be lost, even when competing against other doppels. The commonness of this type of inversion is likely not much however, and both forms would probably be more readily beaten by competing non-doppels, should they exist.

Entropy in the central language, trends upward temporarily due to the initial levelling of the frequency distribution, then drops rapidly as presented below in Figure [[fig:centreentropy]] below:
#+CAPTION[Variability in Central node]: The entropy curve of the central language of the star network.
#+NAME: fig:centreentropy
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil
[[./diagrams/starcentralentropy.png]]

The entropies in the satellites all trend immediately down, shown below in Figure [[fig:satentropy]].

#+CAPTION[Variability in satellite nodes]: Satellite entropies all trend downward due to the distribution of the form frequencies only growing further apart, reducing variability.
#+NAME: fig:satentropy
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil :scale 0.4
[[./diagrams/starouters.png]]
The entropy change in the central community is faster and reaches it's lowest entropy state much sooner than that of the satellite communities.

*** Importance of this result
So languages with more contact with other language speakers will diverge from the languages it is in contact with. Potentially a very distinct language within a wider group of more similar languages is indicative of considerable contact between this and the surrounding languages, but less contact between those languages surrounding it. 

** 5 Vertex Path Network Structure
The path network is a relatively common linguistic situation - a dialect or language chain, along which mutual intelligibility often varies. The Path network is as follows in Figure [[fig:pathnet]].
#+CAPTION[5 node path network]: A path network consisting of 5 nodes connected in series.
#+NAME: fig:pathnet
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil :scale 1
[[./diagrams/pathout.png]]
If the situation has evolved from a common ancestor language, or there has been some period of diffusion of lexical forms, and bilinguals are motivated monitor their production, we might expect to see forms shared in multiple non-contiguous language groups. When graphing the frequency of forms in languages, we should expect that speakers will be biased against forms used by their neighbours. 3 of the 5 language communities have 2 neighbouring communities. So they will have pressure from bilinguals in two communities. Once again, we assume non-equal frequency of two doppel forms with a mode of 54% and monitoring of 100% with bilingual weighting for all connections at 20%. We look at the frequencies of the forms in each of the 5 languages in Figure [[fig:pathfrequencies]] below.


#+CAPTION[Path network form frequencies]: The frequencies of the path network structure present a very noticeable pattern of alternation of forms over time. 
#+NAME: fig:pathfrequencies
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil :scale .4
[[./diagrams/pathfrequencies.png]]

In the simulations, languages end up with an alternating pattern of most frequent forms. So communities have a form that is the same as a language that they are not in contact with due to the anti-doppel bias against forms that they associate with their neighbours' languages. Further, we examine the variability of the languages over time in Figure [[fig:pathentropy]].


#+CAPTION[Variability in the path network]: The entropies of the languages shows that the amount of variability in the languages at each step is not a straightforward reduction as the language differentiate.
#+NAME: fig:pathentropy
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil :scale 0.4
[[./diagrams/pathentropy.png]]

The sudden change in frequency in Language 1 can also be clearly seen in the entropy of the forms in that language. While there is a general bias against whichever form is associated with a particular language's neighbour(s), the process is much more dynamic than one might assume from graphs such as those reproduced for in the previous chapter from \citet[pp. 275]{EllisonMiceli2017}. Some languages show rapid changes in frequency, but actually require more time for one of the forms to fall out of usage. Consider the graphs of Language 1 and Language 2. Language 1 begins with a very sharp change in form frequencies and overall entropy, yet the loss of the dispreferred form (signalled by the languages achieving minimal entropy) occurs in fewer model steps in Language 2 than in Language 1.

The process is slower when speaker groups are more connected. The 35 Model Steps in which the two-language models of \citet[pp. 275]{EllisonMiceli2017} complete are not sufficient for languages with more connected groups of speakers. Language 5 in this particular simulation does not even reach it's lowest possible entropy within the 100 steps of this run. In real speakers' minds, however, the fact that the form is so low in frequency means that it would be almost out of use before that point was reached.

*** Importance of this simulation
The differing rates of change do indicate that wherever there is an anti-doppel bias it is likely that we won't see clean splits of forms, but more likely there will be languages whose speakers use both forms.


** 5 Vertex Cycle Network Structure
A network that is a cycle, or a closed loop, is similar to the path but the two communities on the 'ends' of the path (or language chain) are in contact. This could occur, for example, in territories arranged around some impassable central barrier, such as a mountain, body of water, or similarly difficult terrain. The network structure is seen in Figure [[fig:5nodenet]].

#+CAPTION[5 node cycle network]: The 5 node Cycle network consists of 5 nodes connected in a loop. Similar to the previous path network, except the end languages are in contact.
#+NAME: fig:5nodenet
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil :scale 1
[[./diagrams/cycle5out.png]]

In this situation we once again consider a group of languages which initially share two forms. The doppel has a higher frequency (2/3) than the non-doppel in all languages. Bilinguals are operating at 54% bilingual mode and strictly monitoring their output at 100%. Due to this we can expect to see results that are similar to the those in Section [[5 Vertex Path Network Structure]]. Below in Figure [[fig:cyclefreq]] are graphs of the forms frequencies in each language.


#+CAPTION[Cycle network form frequencies]: The pattern of alternating forms looks similar to the path network, but this similarity is broken by Language 3, as its bilinguals differentiate it from the two neighbouring languages with alternate forms.
#+NAME: fig:cyclefreq
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil :scale 0.5
[[./diagrams/5cycle2freq.png]]

Where these results differ to those in the path network is how the forms are distributed in the network. Languages 2 and 3 do not have a different Form as would be predicted by the model. The bias against 'Form2' from Language 4 has had the effect of the divergence of the dominant forms used between Languages 3 and 4, but in spite of any bias against Form 1 from bilinguals in Language 5, Form 1 has become dominant in 2 contiguous language communities. The anti-doppel bias relies on the presence of some alternative form which can express the same meaning. Without another candidate form, a speaker won't experience a bias against a doppel because they have no other (non-doppel) option to produce in its stead. This lack of a bias towards another form in bilinguals means that monolingual speakers will continue to produce the form without affecting its frequency of use.

*** Multiple bilinguals with opposing biases
The effect of multiple bilinguals who have different language competencies is observed in language 3. The population has around 10 (20% of 50) speakers who are bilingual in Language 4 and their native Language 3, as well as 10 speakers who are bilingual in Language 2 and their native Language 3. The bilinguals with Languages 2 and 4 have the effect of creating a consistent directional bias against forms in those languages. However, due to the specific configuration of the network structure, Language 2 and Language 4 experience a bias that results in each becoming dominant in the term that the other is biased against. This causes the aforementioned bilinguals in the Language 5 community to show biases against the forms that they associate with their other languages. As this bias is similar for both, the net effect is the overall fluctuating frequencies observed over time. It takes until both of the other languages have settled before it begins to tend towards a singular form. This is clearly evident in the graphs of Entropy for each language in Figure [[fig:cycleentropy]].


#+CAPTION[Variability of forms in the cycle network]: The entropy of the languages in this simulation pattern similarly to those of the path network (Figure [[fig:pathentropy]]), but all entropies in this simulation take longer to reach their minimum, and Language 3 is very variable for much of the simulation. 
#+NAME: fig:cycleentropy
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil :scale 0.5
[[./diagrams/5cycle2entropy.png]]

Here we observe that while the other languages begin to trend towards lower entropy as they diverge from each other, Language 3 has a steady increase in entropy, which only begins to decrease once all the other languages reach their minimal entropy state, around step 60. The fact that the language does trend towards a particular form at this point was unexpected. We had expected a cyclical rising and falling of each form, but this is clearly not the case once the entropy in the other languages drops. 

*** Cause for word formation or borrowing?
The fluctuation of forms in Language 3 results in a high degree of entropy in the language. This also has an effect on the bilinguals of Language 2 and 4. The progression of entropy downward in these languages is slow compared to those languages not in direct contact with the fluctuating language. Acting in moderate bilingual mode with similar frequencies of forms means that the non-target language form is activated more highly in Language 1 bilinguals, causing uncertainty as to whether or not the form that the bilingual is using is the correct form.

This uncertainty may be plausible as a reason for the acquisition of new forms for the meaning, rather than losing forms. With a new form the uncertainty for speakers of Languages 2, 3, and 4 would be reduced, as the languages would be able to diverge completely, as would normally be expected. Such situations may, therefore, make speakers more likely to create new forms or predispose them to accepting innovative forms, that are distinct from other languages that they have contact with.

** Simulating a large plausible real-world scenario.
In order for these theoretical simulations to be associated to real-world data, we want to compare the outputs of simulations to data from the world. Ideally, such real-world data would have extensive records from which one could glean information about word frequencies, older unused words, and the social situation of the speakers. Ideally we could discern an approximate proportion of bilingual speakers in the community, and how they might interact in their daily lives. Such data, has not been used for the simulations in this study, due to the circumstances of the project's inception as described in the introduction (Section [[Introduction]]). This ideal data likely does not exist in any form; we have to work with what is available. The data used for the purposes of a large network comparison simulation was sourced from the Chirila Database of Australian indigenous language data \citep{BowernCHIRILA2016}, with a focus on the languages present within and at the edges of the present day state of Victoria. These encompass a sizeable portion of the south-eastern indigenous languages of Australia. The languages used are those for which there was corresponding territory map data within the Chirila database. We don't know the status of these lects as languages; in some cases, they might just be separate territories of speakers of the same language (cf.\citep[pp. 1-58]{BlakeRiedColac1998}). For the data chosen, this thesis assumes that there are 34 territories, each of which consider themselves to be speaking a separate language to their neighbouring territories' speakers. However in contrast the lexicostatistical approach in the aforementioned \citet{BlakeRiedColac1998}, sees 11 languages, with some of those possessing significant dialectal variation \citep[pp. 3]{BlakeRiedColac1998}. Blake and Reid acknowledge that it may be misleading to use the word 'language' in their classification, and hesitate to use the term 'dialect' without specification of the source language from which the dialect stems, and the same warnings of confusion may be relevant to the discussion here. The primary focus of this simulation and comparison is on the network structure, that is, on the relationships between groups which may have existed between groups in pre-colonial times. Lacking direct evidence, we take the spatial territory data as primary in the investigation. The anti-doppel bias is based on bilingual cognitive processing, and as such whether or not a 'dialect' of a language counts enough to exhibit a bias is dependant on the speaker's specific attitudes. With the focus on spatial data, we are assuming that these different groups considered themselves to be different enough to warrant monitoring to a reasonable degree. At the very least they had low enough bilingual mode to not lead to convergence of forms.

*** Real-World Data
An 'Indicator Meaning' was chosen to compare to the simulation. In an attempt to avoid common shared vocabulary, cultural items, or forms which have minimal synonyms the animal 'possum' was chosen as the Indicator Meaning. The data does include alternate meanings adjacent to 'possum', such as different types of possum, but only words glossed solely as 'possum' were used to produce this data. Unfortunately while this vocabulary wasn't cultural or commonly shared, there is not data for every language spoken within each territory that is mapped. 

If we look at the distribution for the chosen 'indicator meaning', we see a number of forms that cluster around certain areas. Each form below (Figure [[fig:sharedforms]]) occurs in at least 2 of the territorial areas. Note that some areas have synonyms and occur in more than one of the maps.
$\newpage$

#+CAPTION[Map of shared forms in Victoria]: Each choropleth map shows the territories in which a particular form occurs. Some areas have no evidence for any shared forms and are shaded grey with diagonal hatching.
#+NAME: fig:sharedforms
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil :scale 0.6
[[./diagrams/sharedFormmaps2.png]]


While most of the forms here cluster together in some way, the form "Wongkuri" occurs quite separately in both Boonwurrung territory on the southern coast, and also in Ngarrindjeri in the West.

$\newpage$
There also exist a number of terms which are not shared between any territories, as in Figure [[fig:uniqueforms]] below:


#+CAPTION[Map of unique forms in Victoria]: Forms in this choropleth are evident in the data only for the language spoken in a single territory. These languages may also have more widespread synonymous forms.
#+NAME: fig:uniqueforms
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil :scale 0.5
[[./diagrams/nonsharedformmap.png]]

These languages are also interesting as many have multiple synonyms present. The border languages possibly do share forms with other languages that are not considered in this study. The isolated forms on the southern coast in the Warrnambool and Kolakngat territories, are interesting as they are not found elsewhere and have no obvious source of borrowing.

*** The Simulated Results
For these simulations a single meaning (the 'indicator meaning') was used. This was initialised to have one form that is shared across all languages at 2/3 frequency and a second form which is either a form dissimilar to the doppel that is present in data for the particular group of speakers, or a unique form that is made up and not present in the data. These made-up forms were used where there was only evidence for the form which was chosen as the doppel for the purposes of the simulation, or where there was no data for the chosen meaning in the data for the community of speakers associated with that territory. We see that there is precedent for these single territory, unshared forms, as demonstrated by the isolated forms in the previous choropleth map \citep{warfChoropleth2010}. 

A variety of scenarios were simulated, in which the parameters of bilingual speakers' Mode and Monitoring were altered, along with the proportion of Bilingual speakers in each community. The choice of which form to use as the doppel was decided by which form was the most common in the data. The form chosen was present, or has a very similar form present, in most varieties from the data. This choice was made due to this form having the most evidence of being present in many of the varieties analysed, and therefore is a candidate for widespread usage in the region. This really is arbitrary in essence, as we would expect any original region-wide doppel to be present in only a few languages, spread out over the region.

Simulations have uniform bilingual weighting across the entire network, ranging from 5% bilingual (0.05) to 50% bilinguals (0.5) in 0.05 increments, and an additional weighting of 100% (1.0), for a fully bilingual population. The Mode and Monitoring parameters tested were intended to explore the extremes of the system for simplicity:
- Mode 0%, Monitoring 0%
- Mode 100%, Monitoring 0%
- Mode 100%, Monitoring 100%
- Mode 0%, Monitoring 100%
Additionally we test the best fit parameters from \citet{EllisonMiceli2017}: Mode 54%, Monitoring 100%.

*** Comparing Simulations to the Real-World Data
We want to find a simulation from this set that is the best approximation for the real-world data to see how well the model can predict the distribution of forms. We want to measure the average number of potential doppels where contact occurs. To do this we will use a simple binary encoding, where if two languages in contact share a form, they will have a value of 1, and if they do not share a doppel the value of this connection shall be 0. Then for each language community or territory we can have a measure of how similar their vocabulary is for the particular meaning. We also can take an average across the whole network. We do this for both the real-world data and the simulated data, at which point we can compare them to determine which of the above combinations of mode, monitoring, and network weight is most comparable between the simulated and real data. For gaps in the real data I rely on surrounding languages and reports of similarity to decide on whether or not to put in a form that is shared.

E.g. Kurnai in the south east is very similar according to \citet{Hercus1969} to the other langauges in the region, and considers them to be dialects of the Kurnai language. Many sources do not use the territory labels given in the map data used (Muk-Thang, Nulit, Thangguai) and rather use group names (Brataulung, krauatungalung, Braiakaulung, Tatungalung, and Brabralung) all of whom are regarded as being speakers of Kurnai. Therefore, I regard these varieties as likely sharing a form, or forms, where appropriate based on such reasoning. Other reasoning such as this is done whenever we have a language without data for the Indicator Form. If many linguists consider them to be closely related, I have assumed that the forms present are the same unless evidence dictates otherwise.

**** How the comparisons were made

The process for comparing the real-data to the output from the simulations was to assess both the average of all shared forms across the entire network, as well as looking at whether individual pairings of languages joined by a border shared a form or not. This was only done for a single-meaning simulation.

To calculate the individual shared values, we looked at each community node in the network and considered the adjacent neighbouring communities as a sub-network of the whole. As we only assessed the direct adjacent neighbours of each node, this gives a sub-network that is similar in structure to the star-type network in Section [[5 Vertex Star Network Structure]] earlier in this chapter. When considering the neighbours we again considered whether or not there was a form that was shared between the community node in question as well as the specific neighbour. If the two share any form, we assign a value of 1 to this pairing, and 0 if not. We then divided the total number of forms shared in this local sub-network by the number of edges. This gives us a value of how many forms each network shares with it's neighbours.

Both of these measures were calculated for both the network based on the real data as well as the simulation results. These values were then compared.

**** The results of the comparison

To compare the average shared form score across the network, we took the difference between the value for the real data and the simulated result. We then took the absolute value of this difference, such that the smallest result from this process would be the closest value to the real-data. This found that the closest result from the simulations was a value of 0.029 compared with a value of 0.417 for the real data. So there was around 3% of forms shared on average between each pairing of languages for the real data, and we found a measurement of around 41% shared for the simulated data. The parameters of the model for this value were Mode: 54% and Monitoring:100%, with a network weight of 5%. 

For the individual we first took the sum of all the average individual shared form scores for both the real and simulated data. Then we again took the absolute value of the difference between the real and simulated values that were calculated. This again means that values which are the most similar will be the lowest calculated result between the real and simulated data. For this we the best match from our data was a simulated sum of  1.0, compared to a real resultant sum of 12.9. The parameters of the model for this value were Mode: 54% and Monitoring: 0%, with a network weight of 5%.

These two values tell us something about our simulated data. Compared to the data, our best model predicts a more diverse set of forms would be present if each language began with a shared form and had a form unique to it, around 5% of speakers spoke more than 1 language, and they had a reason to monitor their output. A choropleth plotting these results is shown below in Figure [[fig:bestfitwhole]]:

While the set of simulations run is minimal, with only 66 total simulations having run in the narrow range of parameters supplied, the fact that the best match with the assumptions made is around 3% of forms shared on average does indicate that there are assumptions in this model that do not fit with the reality we observe. 

On a per-language basis of measurement, our data also does not adequately predict the situation that we see in these languages in Victoria based on the evidence that we have. The closest fit for this measurement predicts that if we began with a widespread doppel and a unique form for each language, with around 5% of speakers being bilingual and no reason to monitor their output strictly, we would have a situation in which all these languages will share the same form. A choropleth map of these results is shown below in Figure [[fig:bestfitnode]]:

We can see that the simulations predicted by the closest simulated match to the real data measurements are not very good predictors of the situation that we observe in the data today. Where the data is diverse, near the boundaries of the map our data looks good, however we do not observe the clustering that we find in the real data, where areas share forms.


* Discussion and Conclusions
** Possible reasons for the differences between Simulations and Reality :noexport:
There are a number of reasons as to why our simulation do not tend to be a good match for the situation that we observe in the real data. The assumptions being made in the model are what make the model, and it does appear that the assumptions made when modelling the language situation in Victoria were not adequate.
*** Languages and Boundaries
As previously discussed, the correlation between language boundaries and tribal boundaries does not correspond exactly. we will quote Dixon again "The boundary between two languages will always run along a tribal boundary; but not every tribal boundary is a language boundary" \citep[pp. 37]{DixonAusLang1980}. The assumption that was made in this modelling process was that these boundaries did align. The fact that the real data shows clustering of forms and ours does not gives a good indication that the model assumptions that these groups spoke different languages when they lived in different territories was not correct. 

*** Monitoring and Target Languages
We assumed that speakers in different tribal areas would have some reason to monitor their output to ensure that they were speaking a language that was the same as the language associated with the owners of the territory. Having the target language for all simulated speakers be the language that was assigned to the community does not allow for situations such as those in the aboriginal community of Warruwi on South Goulburn Island in the Northern Territory. This community is documented as having 9 different indigenous languages in use by speakers who frequently address each other in different languages \citep{Singer2018}. This type of 'receptive multilingualism' may have been practised by speakers in Victoria, but our model would not capture that situation. The potential diachronic effects of this type of multilingualism may be another avenue of investigation for later studies.

*** The Initial lexicon
Our assumptions for running the model with an initial lexicon consisting of a single form that was widely shared and a unique form for each language means that our simulated speakers will always have an alternative word to use if they are avoiding the use of the doppel form. Clearly this is going to mean that  whatever simulation that is run is going to turn out more diverse than the real situation, especially if the real situation had far fewer alternative forms. The other issue with this assumption is that the doppel form was chosen to be present in every language. While the most plausible way for this to have occurred is due to inheritance from a common ancestor, this does not account for any changes that occur in the interceding years. We cannot account for groups which split off to colonise new territories and may have developed in their own forms which were then carried on by subsequent splits and migrations. The fact that we assume a single doppel for the whole region, means that we are also assuming any developments or migrations either did not happen or were fast enough that the languages did not get a chance to change significantly before the model starts.

*** Bilingualism is universal and Contact over tribal boundaries
The network structure that is being modelled in these simulations assume that
- bilingualism occurs everywhere at a constant rate,
- that languages in contact will have a significant number of bilingual speakers,
- that there are not any asymmetrical relationships where one group speaks the language of another more than that groups speaks their language,
- and that there was actually contact between groups with shared boundaries.

Assuming a universal level of bilingualism ignores the inter-group relationships and politics of indigenous Victorians. For example the 'Djilamatang' tribe is said to be 'at enmity with the Jaitmatang, Walgalu, and Ngarigo' \citep[pp. 204]{TindaleTribes1970}. While we only have tribal boundary data in our map for the Ngarigu, would we reasonably be able to assume that a number of warring groups, the latter three of which allegedly 'united to exterminate the Djilamatang people' in post-colonial times, would have shared bilingual speakers? I would suggest not, but other reasons besides conflict could mean that groups do not have a significant population of bilingual speakers. It could be simply too difficult to move through the terrain in large enough numbers, or the groups have no need of an external relationship with a particular other group.

But this picture does not account for any changes that occur in the interceding years. We cannot account for groups which split off to colonise new territories and may have developed in their own forms which were then carried on by subsequent splits and migrations. The fact that we assume a single doppel for the whole region, means that we are also assuming any developments or migrations either did not happen or were fast enough that the languages did not get a chance to change significantly before the period simulated by the model starts.

*** Bilingualism is universal and Contact over tribal boundaries
The network structure that is being modelled in these simulations assume that
- bilingualism occurs everywhere at a constant rate,
- that languages in contact will have a significant number of bilingual speakers,
- that there are not any asymmetrical relationships where one group speaks the language of another more than that groups speaks their language,

I would suggest not, but other reasons besides conflict could mean that groups do not have a significant population of bilingual speakers. It could be simply too difficult to move through the terrain in large enough numbers, or the groups have no need of an external relationship with a particular other group.

*** The use of a single meaning
A single meaning was used because the running of the simulation was slow. The number of calculations done was quite substantial for a single meaning with many forms, and scaling to use many meanings with many forms proved to not be viable due to time constraints. The development time and processing time were simply too much to be able to add for this thesis. This means however, that our single chosen 'indicator meaning' has to be robust to adequately capture the level of lexical similarity present in the languages of the region. This is obviously going to be impossible with a single meaning, and we just wanted to use a reasonably diverse form for which we had data. The specific choice of 'possum' as the meaning was based on it being the meaning that was the most commonly found in the data, which was not a body part. Body parts were avoided due to many being commonly without synonyms. Future studies without the limitation of an honours project will preferably use more forms.
** Considerations for further improvements to the model
Improvements to this implementation of the model are important to consider for future research. 
*** Generations
Populations in the current model are static over time. Only the frequency at which they produce forms impacts from one step to the next. Having the same proportion of bilinguals over long periods does not necessarily model a realistic scenario. We also know that "language use is intrinsically correlated with speaker age" \citep[pp. 43]{tagliamonte2012}. Therefore, speakers having different frequencies for different age groups may be important for making the model more robust, but needs to be assessed in further research. Additionally producing new generations or age-groups which have these different frequencies via agent "reproduction" would be interesting to investigate. Agents could reproduce by pairing with others in their generation and passing their languages (or a subset of them) to a newly "born" agent, such that the proportion of bilinguals varies predictably over time. Investigating whether or not these additions to the simulation would be beneficial or detrimental are a subject for future studies.
*** Multiple meanings
Due to the computational time required by additional meanings, the simulation could not be run with many meanings. Increasing the the number of meanings (and thus, forms) slows the program considerably. The hours required to run the simulation with a variety of forms for each meaning was not viable for inclusion in this thesis. However, instead of relying on tracking specific forms in the real languages over time, to match simulation results to, a percentage of shared forms could instead be measured. Tracking the percentage of shared forms, rather than any specific forms allows the use of lexicostatistical differences, which are more accessible for the region that is considered in this thesis (cf. \citep[pp. 4]{BlakeRiedColac1998}).
*** Mode and Monitoring are set at initialisation
The Mode and Monitoring parameters in this model are set at model initialisation and do not vary over time. These parameters are able to be set individually within the model, but they do not vary over time. This means that we assume that speakers will always be monitoring at the same level and will always be in a fixed bilingual mode, even as both of these parameters are variable over time \citep{deGroot2011, Grosjean2012}. Making these variable based on feedback from the environment and other agents would go a long way towards modelling more individual variation that would be present. The effects that this has on the emergent properties of the languages would be of interest for further study. 
*** Accommodation of more varied bilingualism
In this model, being bilingual means that you are a highly competent speaker in both languages. Yet bilinguals need not be equally competent in both languages to still count as being bilingual. Bilingualism "can include the knowledge and use of two or more languages, the presentation of information in two languages, the need for two languages, the recognition of two or more languages, and so on" \citep[pp. 1]{psychoBiGrosjean}. The anti-doppel bias presents itself in competent speakers, but whether or not it is important to study the additional effects of less-competent bilingual individuals interacting with these competent-bilinguals is another possible avenue for future research.
** Conclusions
In this thesis we modelled the effects of observed bilingual biases in lexical selection on interconnected communities of speakers. We ran simulations consisting of competing doppel and non-doppel forms in a variety of networks and assessed the impact that bilinguals had on the frequency of these forms. We found that the anti-doppel bias affects multilingual communities, but with more languages the speed of the change is reduced. We also examined the effect of bilingual speakers on language variability. We found that variability of languages increases when bilinguals monitor their speech and their behaviour is towards the bilingual end of the language mode continuum. 

Attempts to find a good fit between simulation data and evidence from the real languages being modelled was unsuccessful. The simulations that we did run were not a good fit. The best fit for the whole network average of shared forms greatly overestimated the lexical diversity in the region. The best fit for the individual language shared forms greatly underestimated the lexical diversity in the region. The simulations that were assessed were a small subset of the possible parameter combinations, which limited our search space greatly. This can be improved upon in further studies by efficiently searching the possible parameters of the model. This could be accomplished by optimisation of the model parameters to fit the real-world data. Optimisation can be accomplished with optimisation algorithms such as Simulated Annealing \citep{Varty}, or a Genetic Algorithm \citep{Yang2021}. 

This thesis has also led to the creation of a model program which is extensible enough for using in future investigations into the effect of bilingual speakers on language lexical forms. With minor changes to the code base, this can be expanded upon for use in the further areas of study that have been previously indicated, and much of that functionality already exists. Improvements do still need to be made to certain aspects of the program, as discussed in Section [[Considerations for further improvements to the model]] above. While the intention of using the model to predict lexical diversity in Victoria and match this diversity with real world data did not work well, we have gained some insights. We now have more information about how lexical forms pattern according to the anti-doppel bias. We have also looked into how the variability of lexical forms is affected by bilinguals.  This information is a good step towards using this method for identifying contact scenarios in future research.
