/What types of multilingual speaker interaction can help to explain the synchronic patterns of lexical difference in Victorian Aboriginal Languages?/
#+end_quote

In this study, I will be producing various models of lexical change in an attempt to find a model which has the best fit for the synchronic lexical patterns observed in Victorian Aboriginal languages. The model will include a variety of parameters, including the possible effects of the  \textsc{anti-doppel bias}, a production bias against word forms common to a bilingual's languages, which has not been previously considered. 

This research question is based on Historical linguistic principles of applying known synchronic processes over time in an attempt to find out about the linguistic past of languages and their communities of speakers.

The Victorian Languages are comprised of 3 groups; listed from west to east in general geographical area, they are: Upper-Murray languages, Kulin languages, Gippsland languages (Hercus, L.A.)

** The Language Class
The language class is a class to represent the set of languages in this study. Languages are represented by dictionary objects where the Keys are Meanings /s/, and the Values are a list of tuples of form /f/, a tally of the number of times the form has been used, and a tally that is updated at each step. A single meaning can be mapped to many synonymous forms, and as such, the tuples are inside a list.

The tally is the number of times that the form is used which will be used within a step. So all agents will use the frequency calculated from this number when they are activated and perform their step() method. The NewTally is the value to which the use of a form by an agent is added. This tally will be set to the be tally at the end of the Model class' step() method. This is to prevent the usage of a term in one agent's step() from affecting another within that same timeframe, UNLESS this is an intended effect. 
:question:
- "/This is to prevent the usage of a term in one agent's step() from affecting another within that same timeframe, UNLESS this is an intended effect./"
Ask mark or Luisa if this is something that I should consider doing. 
:END:

#+BEGIN_CENTER
/Therefore/ {Meaning : [(form1,tally,NewTally), (from2,tally,NewTally)]}
#+END_CENTER
The Relative frequency of the form can be determined randomly; with the generation of a random number for each of the forms, which will be divided by the total number of uses for the meaning.

In order to identify the form for t = l checking, the last character of the form strig should be an identifier associated with the language which it is a part of. I also need this system to be able to account for borrowing (not necessarily for the speakers, but rather for data collection). So perhaps something like: if(form[-1].isdigit() and form[-1] == targetlanguageid): do x, elif form[-1].is
*** Variables and arguments
- LanguageName :: is an argument which is used to correlate real-world languages with the simulation. A variable of the same name keeps track of this in the model.
- formMeaningDict :: is a dictionary which kees track of the meanings across languages. It has keys which are the English meta-language meaning of the lexical items and its values are lists of tuples which contain the /form/ of the lexical item, a tally of its use frequency, and a counter which will increase its frequency depending on its use in any step() after all agents have acted, so that the new frequency only affects the subsequent step.
- speakers :: is a list which contains the speakerAgent objects which have this language as their L1, i.e. the 0th item in their language repertoire list is this object.  
*** Methods and Functions
- add_from_file(self, filename) :: this function will take data from a format and convert it to key : value pairs for insertion into the /formMeaningDict/ dictionary.
- add_meaning(self, meaning, formTupleList) :: is a fuction which takes a meaning string, and a list of tuples and adds it to the dictionary of the language.
- add_speaker(self, SpeakerAgent) :: takes a speakerAgent object and adds the object to the list of speakers for the language.

** The Community Class
*** About
The Community class is the class which is used to group Speaker agents into communities of speakers. The Community object are then linked together on a network using networkx.

#+begin_src python :tangle model.py
class Community:
    def __init__(self, name, language, size=150):
        self.communityName = name
        self.communityMembers = []
        self.communityLanguage = language
        self.communitySize = size

    def add_members(self, Speaker):
        if(type(Speaker) is Speaker_Agent):
            self.communityMembers.append(Speaker)
        else:
            print("not a speakerAgent")

    def list_members(self):
        print(self.communityMembers)
#+end_src
** Agent
The Agent in this model represents a Speaker of a set of Languages. They have language mode and language monitoring parameters and a repertoire of languages which they can use. At Each step of the model simulation, Agents will choose a  Meaning /s/, and attempt to produce a target from /t/, based on the language they are aiming to speak in. The target language will be the language that is assigned to the community of which they are a member.

*** Variables & arguments
- name :: is an argument required by the Mesa Agent parent class.
- model :: is an argument required by the Mesa Agent parent class.
- mode :: is the parameter representing how the speaker selects from their repertoire of language. In \textsc{monolingual mode} (b = 0), a speaker behaves (as similarly as possible) as a monolingual speaker would, restricting production to a single language. In \textsc{bilingual mode} (b = 1) the speaker freely mixes their languages in production.
- monitoring :: is a parameter representing how closely a speaker is monitoring their speech production for intrusions from another language in their repertoire.
- L1 :: represents the native language of a speaker. This takes a Language Object, as defined in the language class.
- language_repertoire :: is a list of Language Objects that represents the Agent's proficiency in languages. If a language is in an Agent's list, the agent can proficiently use that language.    
*** Functions/Methods
- language_repertoire_add(self, language) :: adds the given language object to the Current Agent's (self) language_repertoire list
- set_language_mode(self, mode, L1) :: this method sets the speaker's language mode parameter. The default value /False/ will cause the parameter to be a randomised variable (the seed for this random variable is instantiated by the Model Class).If the value is set to a float between 0 and 1, this number will be used for the mode. When the value is /True/ the value is determined based on how many languages are shared by other agents with the same L1.

  This is an average of the ratio of shared languages to total languages spoken by this Agent, between this Agent and all others with th same L1.

Speaker 1 has (L1, l2, l3, l4, l5);
Speaker 2 has (L1, L3, L4);
Speaker 3 has (L1, L4, L5);
Speaker 4 has (L1)

|    | s1 | s2  | s3  | s4  |              mode: | mode fraction |
| s1 |  1 | 3/5 | 3/5 | 1/5 |     0.466666666667 | 7/15          |
| s2 |  1 | 1   | 2/3 | 1/3 |     0.666666666667 | 6/9           |
| s3 |  1 | 2/4 | 1   | 1/4 | 0.5833333333333333 | 7/12          |
| s4 |  1 | 1   | 1   | 1   |                  1 | 4/4           |

If this is all good with Luisa and Mark, then great! If not I'll have to ask for some other way to determine this.

- set_monitoring_level(self, monitoring) :: this method sets the monitoring level. The default value /False/ will cause the parameter to be a randomised variable (determined by the seed of the Model). If the value is set to a float between 0 and 1 this number will be used for the monitoring level. When the value is /True/ the monitoring level will be determined by the model. At the present time, this will cause the monitoring level to not be set, as I have not determined what mechanism should affect this. It could be determined by the inverse of the mode -1 (\( \frac{1}{mode} - 1 \)) or as 1-mode.

- step(self) :: is the method executed each time the Agent is  activated by the Model.
  1. choose a meaning, s, to express
  2. calculate posterior probabilities for all the forms, f, across the speaker's languages, L, which can be used to express that meaning.
  3. select the form, f, with the greatest posterior probability to produce.

** Model
The Model is the class which is responsible for activating the agents at each time step. The model will activate each agent with a specific activation schedule (most commonly random activation where each agent is activated once per time step in a random order). I have arbitrarily set the default seed to 12345, as with the same randomisation seed the (pseudo-)random numbers it generates should be the same each time, and thus the run should be identical, save for any parameter changes.
