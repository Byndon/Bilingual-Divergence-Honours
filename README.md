This repository contains the code for Honours project on Bilingual-Led Divergence. The Agent-based modelling models the cognitive model of language change as well as community interactions between agents and agent communities. 
Written in Python3 with the Mesa library. The Networkx and Pandas library are also used.

The Model implements the cognitive process lain out in /Language Monitoring in Bilinguals as a Mechanism for Rapid Lexical Divergence/ by Ellison and Miceli (2017).

The Model is intended to investigate the effects of this process on multilingual Agents in Multiligual language contact situations in South-Eastern Australia.
